Python package for solving the inverse maximum entropy problem with a focus on the pairwise maximum
entropy model, also known as the inverse Ising problem.

See "usage_guide.ipynb" for usage documentation and examples. For more details about the implemented
algorithms, see the accompanying guide on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08216 and the Github
project.
